Cowboy Carter\Beyonce\2024\Country\8.4\The follow-up to Renaissance is a powerful and ambitious country album cast in the singular mold of Beyonce. She asserts her rightful place in the genre as only a pop star of her incredible talent and influence can do.(Pitchfork)
The Aviary\Galantis\2017\Electronic\6.4\Swedish pop duo Galantis are gleeful vocal manipulators who have written for the likes of Britney Spears and Icona Pop. On their new LP, their maximalism takes on the halting sounds of tropical house. (Pitchfork)
Chopin...Scherzi\Seong-Jin Cho\2021\Classical\9.0\The drama, lyricism, rhythm and articulation which different pianists bring to the four Scherzi are as individual to the set as the four scherzi to each other. Cho dazzles with his technical prowess throughout, exhibiting much agility and dexterity but also gentle poetry. (The Classic Review)\
Back in Black\AC/DC\1980\Rock\8.8\For many bands, the sudden and horrific death of their lead singer at the peak of their popularity would be a career-ender. AC/DC took a few weeks to regroup and then recorded one of the biggest albums of all time. (Pitchfork)\

Joker\Todd Phillips\2019\Comedy/Romance\8.9\Subtlety is not Phillips’s strong point. What he does have is an eye for a well-chosen location, an ear for a provocative line of dialogue and a finger on the pulse of very marketable, confrontational (if also “cynical”) entertainment. The Observer (UK)
Avengers: Endgame\Russo Brothers\2019\Action/Sci-fi\8.3\Generous in humor, spirit and sentimentality, Anthony and Joe Russo's Endgame is a surprisingly full feast of blockbuster-making that, through some time-traveling magic, looks back nostalgically at Marvel's decade of world domination. (AP)
Star Wars: Episode III\George Lucas\2005\Sci-fi/Action\8.0\Emerges as the best in the overall series since "The Empire Strikes Back" (Variety)
Black Hawk Down\Ridley Scott\2001\War/Action\7.9\"I've rarely seen so selfless a collection of performances and, in a war movie, so general an absence of rhetoric or guff. (The New Yorker)
